## Development
This section is only inteded if you plan to contribute to TeeAdmin. If you simply want to use the tool, please refer to the _Getting started_ guide above.

### Environment
#### Using Nix (recommended)
If you are on Linux or using WSL on Windows, the easiest way to get started with setting up the TeeAdmin development environment is to [install Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-quick-install).

Once installed, you can simply run the `nix-shell` command at the root of the project. All necessary dependencies will be downloaded the first time and the `node_modules\.bin` directory of the project will be added to the PATH environment variable while using the shell.

#### Manual setup
If you wish to manually setup the development environment, you need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). As of now, these are the only dependencies. But this might change in the future! Keep an eye on this README or simply choose the Nix way ðŸ˜‰

### Building & Debugging
